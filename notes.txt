//how to use:

 node authorization_code\app.js

 After hitting the login button, we are redirected to  authorization_code/index.html



//layout:

 app.js launches the node application listening on: localhost:8888

 dosearch is binded to the index.html page thru angular, but barely,
 and it contains exports of useful functions

 index.html is a shabby UI to activate these functions.


 todo:

 //dosearch

 x fixed an auth problem and just got a list of my artists for the first time
 o figure out how to use offset to page thru results? seems like thats what they would like me to do.
